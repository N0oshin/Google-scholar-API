# Google-Scholar-API

## Overview  
During NBA accreditation, authorities often need to display publication details of NITC faculty and students based on specific criteria, such as a particular year or student category (B.Tech, M.Tech, Ph.D.).  

Retrieving this data manually is difficult and time-consuming. This project automates the retrieval of publication details from Google Scholar and tags them accordingly, enabling NITC authorities to efficiently answer NBA-related queries.

## Technology Stack
- **Front-end:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Back-end:** Python (Flask)  
- **Database:** Firebase Realtime Database  

## Features  
1. **User Authentication:** Valid users can log in to the web application.  
2. **Publication Retrieval:** The system extracts information from a research article, including the title, author names, publisher, publication date, and citation details once a Google Scholar link is provided.  
3. **Tagging System:** Users can assign or edit tags for each author (Faculty, B.Tech, M.Tech, or Ph.D. student).  
4. **Search & Filtering:** Users can search for a particular author or filter publications based on the publication year or affiliation.
